# CS465-Full-Stack

Architecture
For the frontend of this application, I used Express with Handlebars which functioned 
as the client-side website, leveraged server-side rending for dynamic generation. 
Additionally, Angular was the admin interface built as an SPA. The SPA offered a dynamic 
user experience on the client side which aided in managing the CRUD operations. 
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database for its schema flexibility and ability to scale 
accordingly. MongoDB aligned with the frontend data handling requirements and enabled an easy 
integration with necessary queries. 

Functionality
To improve the functionality of this application there were many examples of refactoring the 
code over the duration of this project. HTML file were updated regularly as I continued to add 
new functionality and implemented Handlebars. Additionally, refactoring many of the components 
in Angular allows for reusable code, that was able to keep up with the new functions of the application. 

Testing
The frontend was tested for conditional rendering of admin features, as well as the ability to 
interact with the backend in order to perform CRUD operation. The interaction with the database 
from HTTP methods of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. API endpoints were tested for the client-sides 
ability to communicate with the server. Regarding security, an authentication was enacted for users 
giving the valid JWT. 

Reflection
This course has helped me to gain a better understanding of full stack development, and how 
certain components of the frontend, backend, and database can come together to create a successful 
project. Prior to this course I had not used Express, or Angular. This course also helped to 
improve my JavaScript knowledge.
